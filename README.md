***This README file contains a little bit about our goals for the project and some Git basics. I know it's a lot of information right now, but much of it will be used for reference if you are confused with something and need some basic instruction to jog your memory!

This repository will be utilized to collaborate amongst each other and keep our source code in one place!!

If you have never used Git or GitHub before, here is some basic terminology and instruction: 

What's the Difference Between Git and GitHub?

Git is the actual version-control system. It allows you to save changes made to source files and also allows you to "upload" changes made by other members of your group onto the file you are presently working on. 

GitHub is really just an extension of Git. It's essentially a cloud or hosting service that can store local files remotely. GitHub will allow us to easily retrieve our project files that have been edited by someone in the group.


Basic Terminology:
Repository- This can be thought of as really just a folder. It stores all versions of the source files in an organized manner. The repository can either be local (the one on your computer) or remote (the one on github.com)
Commits- These are just saved versions of your code. This is analogous to clicking "save" when you are constructing a project.
Branches- These are where commits are stored.

So.... commits are stored in branches, and branches are stored in the repository. 

We will be using the command-line to work with Git and GitHub, so here are some of the commands (which will be given context later in the file)!

Some basic commands:
git clone *url here*  --This will "clone" the remote repository onto your local computer. 
git status   -- This basically tells us the difference between our local repository and remote repository
git add  --Utilized basically anytime we create a new file or need to commit something
git commit  --This tells Git to create a snapshot of our current code and locks in the changes we have made to the source file on the local repository
git push  --This saves all of our local changes to the remote repository on GitHub
git pull --This retrieves changes made by other people who "pushed" these changes to the remote repository back into your local repository

Steps to Take When Using GitHub:
1. If you don't yet have the repository saved on your local computer, clone the
